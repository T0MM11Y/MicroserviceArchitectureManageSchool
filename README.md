## Modular Microservices Architecture Overview

This project exemplifies a strategic transformation from a monolithic architecture to a highly modular microservices-based system. The application is thoughtfully segmented into eight distinct modules, each running on an individual port and engineered for independent operation. This modular separation enables each service to function autonomously, providing uninterrupted performance across the platform even if one or more modules experience downtime or require maintenance.

By embracing a microservices architecture, the system achieves superior robustness, flexibility, and scalability. Independent modules can be updated, scaled, or debugged without affecting the functionality of others, which streamlines ongoing management and accelerates future development. This design greatly improves fault tolerance and ensures seamless continuity for users and administrators alike.

Below is a visual representation of the microservices system architecture:
