🏗️ Within this context, we have successfully divided the monolithic architecture into eight distinct modules, each with a different port. 
Each of these modules operates independently, meaning they can function autonomously. This independence ensures that if one module is shut down or encounters an issue, 
the remaining modules can continue to run smoothly without interruptions. This modular approach enhances the system's overall robustness and flexibility, making it easier to manage and scale. 🚀
