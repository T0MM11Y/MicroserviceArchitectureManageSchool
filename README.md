## Modular Microservices Architecture Overview

In this project, we have transitioned from a monolithic architecture to a modular microservices-based system, successfully dividing the application into eight distinct modulesâ€”each running on its own dedicated port. Every module is designed to operate independently, allowing for autonomous functionality and seamless service continuity.

This independence means that if one module is stopped or encounters an issue, the remaining modules continue to function without disruption. This approach significantly enhances overall system robustness, flexibility, and scalability, making management and future development much more efficient.

Take a look at the system architecture below:
